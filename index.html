He then walks into a tavern and buys some roast chicken which he then eats alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">[koretake in his mind: Mmmm what good meat.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">After maybe an hour of this dream he wakes up, yawns and stretches then goes to the kitchen and pours himself a bowl of cereal while watching a show. After breakfast he puts on his winter jacket and heads outside into the beautiful white snow. He looks over to the neighbors yard and see&rsquo;s a nice cute snowman made by their children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">After admiring the snowman for a little while he continues walking down the road. Admiring and envying each family, each happy family enjoying their christmas morning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">[Koretake thinking: it&rsquo;s a shame i don&rsquo;t have a family like that.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">He continues walking down the street until he arrives downtown At the local bookstore. Skip maybe 5 minutes and he&rsquo;s leaving the store with a couple new manga. As he exits the store he sees another happy family with another happy snowman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">But that was the last he saw of his world!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Everything went black he bagan freaking out. What had happened had he died? Plus if he had how just a second ago he was perfectly fine walking across the street.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Slowly his vision went all white and colors started appearing. He was now in a green forest covered in vines and pretty flowers scattered across the grass and all over the trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">[Koretake: What where am I honestly it was winter just a minute ago and now it&rsquo;s mid summer weather. I&rsquo;ve also been teleported to a forest all of the sudden too]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Koretake begins heading west</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">[koretake: I&rsquo;ve always had luck when heading west so who knows maybe I&rsquo;ll find a cursed dagger or a magic scroll]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">He walks west exploring tons of interesting ruins and structures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">He explores a collapsed mine with pretty shiny red gems some of which he pockets hoping to sell them in a nearby town. He continues walking for two hours before eventually getting tired and going to sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The next morning he wakes up and does his morning routine but slightly different due to his current conditions. And continues the voyage west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">He sees an old broken down wood tavern with a sign saying &ldquo;Bajoi banjo tavern&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">[koretake: hmm i mean if there&#39;s a tavern here there must be a town or village nearby and also assuming that&rsquo;s a tavern. I have to have been transported to a fantasy world.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">So he continues for a few minutes before coming across a village. He asks for help but when the villagers see him they run in their homes and hide from him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">And in a few more seconds all the buildings poof into dust.</span></p></body></html>
